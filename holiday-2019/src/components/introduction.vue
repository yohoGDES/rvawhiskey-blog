                    Whiskey Holiday Buying Guide
                </h1>

                <p>
                    One of our favorite things to do is to talk about whiskey and this time of year we are often asked for suggestions for gift buying. We decided to pull together a whiskey buying guide for this holiday season for any person / any price range. Trust us, we get that it can be totally intimidating to go to the liquor store and face the walls of bottles. Hopefully this list will give you a great option across a wide range of interests

                    Before we get started there are a few things to note about this list. Everything on this list is available right now in Virginia ABC stores. This is not a list comprised of the regular industry hitters which every whiskey nerd clamours for. These whiskies have been reviewed or tasted by us in the last year and are accessible to people interested in trying something a little different. I know we hate reading reviews and looking at lists of whiskey that are just unattainable in our state, so this list aims to avoid that.

                    There will be some classics, some curve balls, but primarily this list will give whoever you are buying for a great whiskey regardless of their level of interest. Let's jump in!

                <p><strong>We have divided each section up to offer at least one whiskey from each type per price range.</strong></p>
