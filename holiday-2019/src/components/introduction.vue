      2018 Whiskey Holiday Buying Guide
    </h1>
	<p>
		It&rsquo;s that time of year again! Time to spread some holiday cheer and lift the spirits collection of one you love or even for yourself. This is our second annual Holiday Gift Buying Guide.
	</p>
    <p>
	One of our favorite things to do is to talk about whiskey and this time of year we are often asked for
      suggestions for gift buying. We decided to pull together a whiskey buying guide for this holiday season for any
      person / any price range. Trust us, we get that it can be totally intimidating to go to the liquor store and face
      the walls of bottles. Hopefully this list will help you narrow down a selection in a price range and category that suits your needs.

      Before we get started there are a few things to note about this list. Most everything on this list is available right now in Virginia ABC stores. If an item is not available in Virginia, we will note that and provide a link to a vendor where you can research or purchase that item. This is not a list comprised of the standard high dollar impossible lottery bottles that every whiskey nerd clamours for. Instead we've chosen a wide range of whiskies that would make any whiskey fan happy and push them out of the typically Pappy Van Winkle fervor. These whiskies have been reviewed or tasted by us in the last year or are in our own collections. I know we hate reading reviews and looking at lists of whiskey that are just unattainable in our state, so this list aims to avoid that or help you find them.

      There will be some classics, some curve balls, but primarily this list will give whoever you are buying for a
      great whiskey regardless of their level of interest. Let's jump in!
